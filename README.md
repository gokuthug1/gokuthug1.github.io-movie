Watch movies with a imdb or tmdb id and anime.

How to watch anime? Look at steps below:

example: to-love-ru-episode-1

You can enter another "-" after the 1 in the example and put dub or sub.

Enjoy.

Ps: "Pro" option will not work as of right now. And also, for the "Anime2" option, you have to go to https://anilist.co/search/anime and get the id of the anime you want. 

Anime2 option might not work as well as Pro option.
